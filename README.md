node-mongodb-json-server
========================

Testing setting up a RESTful JSON server with Node, Express, Passport authenticaion and mongoDB with node-mongodb-native.

This server store notes.

Express could (hopefully) very easy be replaced with Restify. But I use for now Express for simplicity
since most of the tuturials out there is refering to Express. I might change that later.
See here the reason why you might want to use Restify: http://mcavage.github.com/node-restify/

This is currently a work in progress. My goal is to get it as production ready as possible.
I will include some tips and links along the way.

Please feel free to use the code as you like, MIT style :)

I also did a simple test with mysql: https://github.com/frodefi/node-mysql-json-server
and mongodb and socket.io: https://github.com/frodefi/node-mongodb-socketio-server
